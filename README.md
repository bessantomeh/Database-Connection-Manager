# Database-Connection-Manager
A Java Singleton implementation for managing a single database connection, created as a solution to a course task requiring the application of the Singleton pattern.


Justification for Using Singleton:

Avoid Multiple Connections:

In large applications, frequent database access can be costly regarding performance and resources. The Singleton pattern ensures that only one database connection is created and used throughout the application.

Data Consistency:

Using a single database connection ensures that all operations share the same database context and settings.

Resource Management:

Using a single database connection makes it easier to handle and check the connection, ensuring better management of resources.
